## scala-xml-playground

A repository to play with SVG xmls (specifically, produced by InkScape). This will be later integrated with svgimagesfromallenaipdffigures (https://github.com/svgimagesfromallenaipdffigures) repo. The goals are:

1. Add a bounding box element to each path.
2. Convert each path to absolute co-ordinates.
3. Typically, InkScape combines all text chars in a line inside one single tspan element. Separate them out.
4. More to be added.
